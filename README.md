# What is fly cli

`fly` is the scaffolding tool for all my daily setup around several tech set, like `node-web`, `webpack-starter`, `react-starter`, `typescript-starter`, etc.

***Why do I need it:***

- It forces me to extract the framework of project I was using instead of copying from existing project and being struggled with the business logic which doesn't belong to my need.

- It could be the place to maintain the template with the development of tech.
